## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read_csv("zipVsBailAmount.csv")
zip <- data$zip
bail_amount <- data$bail_amount
#locations <- mutate_geocode(zip, bail_amount)

#write.csv(locations,"zipVsBailAmount.csv")

#dat_new$bail[is.na(dat_new$zip)] <- NA

# Check that it worked

#locations

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
