## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read_csv("parsed1.csv")
zip <- data$zip
bail_amount <- data$bail_amount
# Create new data frame
dat_new <- data.frame(zip=zip, bail_amount=bail_amount)
dat_new <- na.omit(dat_new)
write.csv(dat_new,"zipVsBailAmount.csv")

#dat_new$bail[is.na(dat_new$zip)] <- NA

# Check that it worked

dat_new

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
